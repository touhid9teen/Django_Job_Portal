## Authentication and Authorization

### Authentication

Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system. It ensures that someone trying to access a system or perform an action is indeed who they claim to be. This Job Portal uses custom JWT authentication to verify identities.

#### What are JSON Web Tokens?

JWTs (JSON Web Tokens) are small, secure ways to share information between two parties. They act like digital ID cards for users, holding encoded details about who the user is and what they are allowed to do. Because JWTs contain all necessary information within them, they are well-suited for stateless authentication, meaning web apps don‚Äôt need to store extra data about users on the server.

#### Structure of a JWT

A JSON Web Token (JWT) comprises three main parts: a header, a payload, and a signature. These segments are Base64Url-encoded and concatenated with periods (.) to form the complete JWT.

- **Header**: The header is a JSON object that usually contains two fields: a token type (commonly JWT) and a signing algorithm (e.g., RS256 for RSA SHA-256). It provides details about how the JWT is encoded and secured.
- **Payload**: The payload is a JSON object containing claims and information about the user and other relevant data. Claims are key-value pairs and can be registered, public, or private.

     Common keys within JWT claims include:
     - `iss` (Issuer) ‚Äî identifies the entity that issued the JWT.
     - `sub` (Subject) ‚Äî identifies the user the token is for by storing the user‚Äôs unique identifier.
     - `aud` (Audience) ‚Äî specifies the recipients allowed to process the token.
     - `exp` (Expiration Time) ‚Äî defines when the token expires, in seconds since the Unix epoch.
     - `nbf` (Not Before) ‚Äî defines the earliest time the token can be considered valid, in seconds since the Unix epoch.
     - `iat` (Issued At) ‚Äî indicates when the token was issued in seconds since the Unix epoch.

- **Signature**: The signature is a cryptographic hash created using the encoded header, payload, and a secret key. It ensures the token‚Äôs integrity and authenticity. The encoded header and payload are concatenated with a period (.) and then hashed with the secret key, using a specified algorithm to generate the signature.

     Example of signature creation with RSA SHA-256:
     ```plaintext
     RSASHA256(
               base64UrlEncode(header) + "." +
               base64UrlEncode(payload),
               private_key
     )
     ```

What is Custom JWT Authentication? 
# Django Custom JWT Authentication

Custom JWT authentication means creating a personalized way of using JWTs (JSON Web Tokens) to fit the specific needs of a project. Instead of using ready-made tools (like `django-rest-framework-simplejwt`), we build our own methods for:

- **Creating tokens**: Choosing what information to include, setting custom expiration times, or using specific security algorithms (e.g., RSA for stronger security).
- **Checking tokens**: Writing our own methods to verify tokens to match special security needs or add extra checks.
- **Connecting with user data**: Adding specific user details or roles that fit the business logic of the project.

## Extending BaseAuthentication

Extending `BaseAuthentication` and overriding the `.authenticate(self, request)` method. The method should return a two-tuple of `(user, auth)` if authentication succeeds, or `None` otherwise. In some circumstances, instead of returning `None`, we may want to raise an `AuthenticationFailed` exception from the `.authenticate()` method.

### Reasons for Using Django Custom JWT Authentication

- **Flexibility**: Define token payload and structure according to our application's needs.
- **Enhanced Security**: Use custom algorithms, rotate signing keys, or implement more advanced claim verification.
- **Custom Claims**: Include project-specific claims like user roles, permissions, or other contextual data.
- **Integration with Microservices**: Implement JWTs with custom claims to manage multi-service authentication seamlessly.

## Authorization

Authorization in the context of software and web applications refers to the rights or access levels given to users that determine what actions they can perform within the system. Permissions are used to enforce security and control over who can read, write, update, or delete data.

- **Custom User-Based Permissions**: Permissions are handled based on the user type (candidate or employer), with role-based access to different resources. Used extending `BasePermission` class and override `has_permission` method.
- **Custom User Model**: The user model extends Django‚Äôs `AbstractUser`, managed by a custom `BaseUserManager` class to handle user registration, login, and profile management.
- **Email and Phone Login**: Allows users to log in using either email or phone number via a custom authentication backend.

## Account Management

### Custom User Model

Firstly, a custom Users model is created by extending Django's built-in `AbstractUser` class. A custom model manager, `UserManager`, is also created to handle user creation and superuser creation.

#### Why Custom User Model

- **Custom Fields**: We can add extra fields (e.g., phone number, address) to our user model.
- **Custom Logic**: We can implement custom behavior for user management (e.g., overriding user methods or validation rules).
- **Future Flexibility**: We can future-proof our project by having a more flexible user model that can be extended or modified easily.
- **Avoiding Migration Issues**: Starting with `AbstractUser` or a custom user model helps us avoid complex migration issues later if we decide to customize the default User model.

#### Why Model Manager

- **Custom Query Methods**: We can define custom query methods to encapsulate complex or reusable logic, making our code cleaner and more maintainable.
- **Enhanced Code Reusability**: We can centralize database queries within the manager, making it easy to reuse these methods across different parts of the project.
- **Separation of Concerns**: By moving query logic into a model manager, we keep the model itself focused on representing data, and improving code readability and organization.
- **Creating Custom Object Creation Methods**: We can override, extend default methods like `create_user()` or `create_superuser()` to customize how model instances are created.
- **Custom QuerySets**: We can attach custom `QuerySet` methods to provide a fluent and chainable interface for querying data.

## Base URL

The base URL for all API requests is: `https://127.0.0.1:8000` is defined as `{{base_url}}`.

### Basic Information

- **Authorization**: Bearer Token
- **Request and response type**: JSON

## User Registration

### Endpoint

`POST {{base_url}}/account/register/`

### Authentication

None (No authentication required for user registration)

### Function

Registers a new user by serializing the provided data and saving the user instance. After saving the user, a welcome email with an OTP is sent asynchronously using Celery.

### Query

Fetches the user data using the following PostgreSQL query:

```sql
INSERT INTO user (id, email, contract_number, user_type, password, otp) VALUES (id_value, email_value, contract_number_value, user_type_value, password_value, otp_value);
```

### Serialization

The `UserSerializer` is used to validate and serialize the incoming registration data. If the data is valid, the user is saved, and the OTP is generated. After successful registration, the OTP is sent via email asynchronously using Celery.

#### Validation inside serializer

- **Custom Field Validation**: Methods like `validate_email` and `validate_contract_number` are used for custom validation logic specific to each field.
- **Uniqueness Check**: Both the email and contract number are checked against the Users model to ensure they are unique before saving, preventing duplicates.
- **Password Validation**: The password field is marked as `write_only=True` (not returned in responses) and uses Django's built-in `validate_password` function to ensure the password meets Django's default password validation rules (such as length, complexity, etc.).
- **Format and Length Check**: For `contract_number`, additional checks are performed to ensure it has the correct length (11 digits) and proper format (digits only, with country code handling).
- **Error Handling**: If any validation rule fails, a `serializer.ValidationError` is raised with an appropriate error message, which will be returned in the response to the client.

### What is Celery?

Celery is an asynchronous task queue system used for managing background tasks. It allows applications to offload time-consuming operations to worker processes, improving performance and responsiveness.

#### Why Use Celery Here?

- **Asynchronous Processing**: Sending emails can take time, and handling it asynchronously prevents delays in the user registration API response.
- **Scalability**: Celery ensures that tasks like sending OTPs can scale efficiently, even under heavy traffic.
- **Reliability**: By leveraging Celery with a message broker like Redis, tasks can be queued and retried if failures occur.

### Request Body

The body of the POST request should include the necessary data for registering a user, typically containing fields such as `id`, `email`, `contract_number`, `user_type`, and `password`, as required by the custom user model.

```json
{
     "email": "user1@gmail.com",
     "contract_number": "017111111111",
     "user_type": "candidate",
     "password": "1234"
}
```

### Response 201 (Created)

Returns a success message with the generated OTP.

```json
{
   "status": "OTP has been generated",
   "otp": "755745"
}
```

### Response 400 (Bad Request)

Returns errors if the provided registration data is invalid.

```json
{
   "contract_number": [
        "Contract number must contain 11 digits (e.g., 01XXXXXXXXX)."
   ],
   "password": [
        "This password is too short. It must contain at least 8 characters.",
        "This password is too common.",
        "This password is entirely numeric."
   ]
}
```

# OTP Verification Process

## Endpoint
**POST** `{{base_url}}/account/verify_otp/`

## Function
Verifies the OTP and email combination for the user during registration. If valid, the user is marked as verified, and the registration process is completed.

## Request Body
The body of the POST request should include the `otp` and `email` fields.

## Query
The query fetches the user by matching the provided OTP and email from the database:
```sql
SELECT * FROM user WHERE email = request.data['email'] AND otp = request.data['otp'];
```

## Serialization
The request data is validated using the `OtpVerificationSerializer`. The serializer ensures the OTP is a 6-digit numeric value and that both the OTP and email exist in the database.

## Detailed Process

### User Registration
When a user completes the registration process, an OTP is generated automatically. The OTP is created inside the `save` method of the `Users` model using the `generate_otp()` function, which generates a random OTP of a specified length.

### OTP Generation
The `generate_otp()` function uses Python's `random.choice()` to generate a string of digits of length defined by `OTP_LENGTH`. This OTP is saved to the user model‚Äôs `otp` field.

### Celery Task for Sending OTP
After the OTP is generated and saved to the model, a Celery task (`send_welcome_email`) is triggered to send the OTP to the user‚Äôs email. This is done asynchronously using Celery, with Redis as the message broker. The task sends an email containing the OTP to the user.

### Celery Configuration
Celery is configured with Redis as the broker and result backend. The email backend is set up to use Gmail's SMTP server for sending OTP emails.

### OTP Verification
When the user submits the OTP (via the `ValidatedOtpView` API endpoint), the `OtpVerificationSerializer` is used to validate the OTP and email provided. If the OTP and email match the records in the database, the user‚Äôs `is_verified` field is set to `True`, and the OTP is marked as verified. A success message is then returned to confirm registration.

### Error Handling
If the OTP or email doesn‚Äôt match, or any error occurs during validation, appropriate error responses are returned. Additionally, if an exception occurs in the OTP validation process, an internal server error message is sent.

### Signals

#### Signal Definition
A custom signal `otp_verified` is defined using `Signal()` to handle actions after OTP verification.

#### Signal Triggering
The signal is triggered with `otp_verified.send(sender=user.__class__, instance=user)` after successfully verifying the OTP in the `ValidatedOtpView`.

#### Receiver Function
The `create_user_profile` function, decorated with `@receiver(otp_verified)`, listens for the signal and is triggered when the signal is sent.

#### Profile Creation
Inside the receiver function, based on the `user_type` ('candidate' or 'employer'), either a `CandidateProfile` or `EmployerProfile` is created and linked to the user.

#### Outcome
The signal ensures automatic profile creation for the user after successful OTP verification.

### Example Request Body
```json
{
     "otp": "765146",
     "email": "user1@gmail.com"
}
```

### Response 200 (OK)
Returns the success message if the OTP and email are valid and the user is successfully verified.
```json
{
     "status": "Registration successful"
}
```

### Response 400 (Bad Request)
Returns validation errors if the OTP or email combination is incorrect.
```json
{
     "otp": [
           "OTP does not exist."
     ],
     "email": [
           "Email does not exist."
     ]
}
```

### Response 500 (Internal Server Error)
Returns a generic error message if an unexpected error occurs during the OTP validation process.

# User Login

## Endpoint
**POST** `{{base_url}}/login/`

## Function
This view is used for logging in users with either their email or phone number and password. Upon successful login, a token is generated for the user.

## Query
The query fetches the user based on the provided `email_or_phone` value, matching it with either the `email` or `contract_number` field in the database:
```sql
SELECT * FROM user WHERE email = request.data['email_or_phone'] OR contract_number = request.data['email_or_phone'];
```

## Serialization
The request data is validated using the `LoginSerializer`. This serializer first checks whether the `email_or_phone` value is a valid email or phone number. It then ensures the provided credentials (password) match the authenticated user and that the user has been verified.

## Custom Login Process Using Email or Phone Authentication

### Custom Authentication Backend
A custom authentication backend called `EmailOrPhoneBackend` extends `ModelBackend` to allow users to log in using either an email or phone number.

### Username Check
The `authenticate` method checks if the username contains an '@' symbol to differentiate between email and phone number.

### User Retrieval
Depending on the input type, the method queries the `Users` model using either the `email` field or the `contract_number` field.

### Password Validation
The method verifies the provided password using the `user.check_password()` function.

### Return User
If the user exists and the password is valid, the user instance is returned; otherwise, `None` is returned.

### Configuration
Added `EmailOrPhoneBackend` to `AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS` in Django settings to enable the custom authentication method.

## Custom Login Validation and Integration

### Fields Setup
A `LoginSerializer` class is created with fields `email_or_phone` and `password`. The `password` field is set to `write_only=True` for security.

### Custom Identifier Validation
In the `validate_identifier` method, an `EmailValidator()` is used to check if the input is an email. If validation fails, the input is checked if it‚Äôs an 11-digit number to verify if it‚Äôs a valid phone number. If neither check passes, a `ValidationError` is raised with a message prompting for a valid email or phone number.

### Context Flag Setting
Depending on the input type, flags are set in `self.context` as `is_email` or `is_phone` to use later during the authentication process. This helps determine how the `EmailOrPhoneBackend` should handle the input.

### Overall Validation Logic
In the `validate` method, `email_or_phone` and `password` are retrieved from the data dictionary.

### Dynamic Authentication Preparation
`auth_kwargs` is set up with `username` and `password` by default. If the input is identified as a phone number, `auth_kwargs` is adjusted to use `phone` instead of `username`. This step aligns with how the `EmailOrPhoneBackend` checks whether the input is an email or phone number for authentication.

### User Authentication
The `authenticate()` function is called using `auth_kwargs`, which interacts with the `EmailOrPhoneBackend`. This backend processes the input type accordingly and returns the user if authentication is successful. If `authenticate()` returns `None`, a `ValidationError` is raised for invalid credentials.

### Account Verification Check
If the user is found but not verified, a `ValidationError` is raised prompting the user to complete OTP verification.

### Final Return
If validation is successful, the user object is added to the data dictionary and returned for further processing.

## Custom Token Generation in Login Process

### Token Creation Function
A `token_generation` function is implemented to handle the creation of JWT tokens for authenticated users.

### Token Expiry Setup
An expiration time (`exp`) for the token is set to 30 minutes from the current time to ensure session security.

### Payload Structure
The token payload includes essential user information: `id`, `email`, `user_type`, and `contact_number` to support user identification and role-based logic.

### JWT Encoding
The `jwt.encode()` method is used with the payload, a `SECRET_KEY` for encryption, and the `HS256` algorithm to generate a secure token.

### Integration with Login
After successful user retrieval and validation in the `LoginView`, the `token_generation` function is called to create the token and include it in the response.

### Response Handling
The generated token is returned as an `access_token`, which the client can use for subsequent authenticated requests.

## Request Body
The body of the POST request should include `email_or_phone` (either email or phone number) and `password`.
```json
{
     "email_or_phone" : "user1@gmail.com",
     "password" : "qwer0987"
}
```

## Response 200 (OK)
Returns the generated access token if the user credentials are valid and the user is verified.
```json
{
     "access_token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpZCI6MTkzNCwiZW1haWwiOiJ1c2VyNzBAZ21haWwuY29tIiwidXNlcl90eXBlIjoiY2FuZGlkYXRlIiwiY29udGFjdF9udW1iZXIiOiIwMTcxMTExMTE3MCIsImV4cCI6MTczMTQ5NjI0OX0.jmR5bg3HXFMOIcMx3GhudjgkEo4dgKub18zxjj8atH4"
}
```

## Response 400 (Bad Request)
Returns validation errors if the input is invalid or the credentials do not match.
```json
{
     "error": "Token generation failed: Users matching query does not exist."
}
```

## Response 500 (Internal Server Error)
Returns a generic error message if an unexpected error occurs during the token generation process.

- **Serializer**: The paginated queryset is passed to the `UserDetailsProfileSerializer` with `many=True`.
- **Returning Paginated Response**: Returned using `paginator.get_paginated_response(serializer.data)`.
- **Error Handling**: Wrapped in a try-except block to handle potential errors.

### UserInfoView with Nested Serializer:
- **View Setup**: Protected by custom authentication (`CustomAuthentication`).
- **Nested Serialization**: Uses `SerializerMethodField` for `user_details`:
     - If the user is a "candidate", retrieves and serializes using `CandidateSerializer`.
     - If the user is an "employer", retrieves and serializes using `EmployerProfileSerializer`.
     - Returns `None` if the associated profile is not found.
- **Error Handling**: Wrapped in a try-except block to catch unexpected errors.

## Update Password

### Endpoint:
```
PATCH {{base_url}}/account/update-password/
```

### Permission:
Open to authenticated users.

### Function:
Allows the authenticated user to change their password by providing the old password and new password.

### Query:
The password is updated by validating the old password and checking if the new password matches the confirmation. The query involves checking the current password of the user with the old password and then updating the password with the new one.
SQL query for updating the password:
```sql
UPDATE users
SET password = {new_password}
WHERE id = {request.user.id} AND password = {old_password};
```

### Serialization:
The `ChangePasswordSerializer` is used for validating the following fields:
- **Validation Logic**:
     - Check if the password and `confirm_password` match.
     - Validates `old_password` to ensure it matches the current password.
- **Password Update**:
     - `update()` sets the new password using `set_password()` and saves the user instance.
- **Success & Error Responses**:
     - Returns 200 OK on successful change with a success message.
     - Returns 400 BAD REQUEST if validation fails with detailed errors.

### Request Body:
```json
{
      "old_password": "1234",
      "password": "qwer0987",
      "confirm_password": "qwer0987"
}
```

### Response 200 (OK):
Returns a success message if the password change is successful.
```json
{
      "detail": "Password Change Successfully"
}
```

### Response 400 (Bad Request):
Returns validation errors if any of the fields are invalid.
```json
{
      "old_password": {
                "old_password": "Old password is incorrect"
      }
}
```
```json
{
      "password": [
                "Password field does not match"
      ]
}
```

# Search Job

## Job Filtering and Search Implementation

**Endpoint**  
GET `{{base_url}}/job/search/?title=Software Engineer`

**Permission**  
Requires authentication via the `CustomAuthentication` class. Accessible by authorized users with the appropriate permissions.

**Function**  
Filters and retrieves job listings. Applies the filtering logic using `DjangoFilterBackend` and custom filter logic defined in the `JobFilter`.

**Query**  
Fetches jobs using the following query:
```sql
SELECT * FROM job WHERE is_deleted = FALSE;
```
Then, applies additional filtering based on the query parameters, such as job type, experience level, etc. This is done by the `filter_queryset` method in the `DjangoFilterBackend` class.

**Serialization**  
The retrieved Job instances are serialized into JSON format using the `JobDetailSerializer`. The serializer includes details about the employer who created the job and the total number of applications for each job.

## Job Filtering and Pagination

- **Utilize Django Filters**: Set up `DjangoFilterBackend` and defined a `JobFilter` class with customizable filters for fields like title, job_type, job_subtype, experience_level, and location for flexible search options.
- **Filter Application**: Applied filtering logic in the `get()` method by using `DjangoFilterBackend().filter_queryset()` to refine job listings based on user queries.
- **Implement Pagination**: Used `PageNumberPagination` with a `page_size` of 10, allowing segmented data retrieval and improving load times for users.
- **Serialize Paginated Data**: Used `JobDetailSerializer` to convert paginated job data into JSON format for the response, making the data easily consumable.
- **Handle No Results Gracefully**: Added error handling to return a 404 response when no jobs match the filter criteria.
- **Modular and Configurable Settings**: Configured `REST_FRAMEWORK` settings to include the default authentication and filter backends, as well as pagination, enabling consistency and code modularity.

**Response 200 (OK)**  
Returns a list of jobs with pagination and the total number of jobs after applying the filters.

 Applications Management

# Django Job Portal API Documentation

## View All Applications for a Job

### Endpoint
`GET {{base_url}}/application/all/3/`

### Permission
Only accessible by authenticated employers who created the job, as determined by the `IsEmployer` permission class.

### Function
Fetches all job applications for a specific job and provides the job application details, including job and candidate information. It uses caching to improve performance.

### Query
Fetches job applications using the query:
```sql
SELECT * FROM job_application WHERE job_id = job_id AND is_deleted = FALSE;
```

### Caching
The response data is cached with a cache key formatted as `job_applications_{job_id}`. If the job applications are already cached, the cached data is returned immediately, improving response times. If the job applications are not cached, they are fetched from the database, serialized, and cached for future use.

### Serialization
The retrieved job applications are serialized into JSON format using the `JobApplicationCandidateDetailsSerializer`. This serializer includes nested serializers to provide detailed information about the job and candidate.

- The `job` field uses the `JobSerializer` to include details about the job that was applied for.
- The `candidate` field uses the `CandidateSerializer` to include information about the candidate who applied.

### Request Body
No request body is required for this endpoint as it retrieves job applications.

### Response 200 (OK)
Returns the list of job applications for the given job. If the data is cached, it is returned directly from the cache. If not cached, the applications are retrieved from the database, serialized, and cached.

## Submit a Job Application

### Endpoint
`POST {{base_url}}/application/job_id/`

### Permission
Only accessible by authenticated candidates, as determined by the `IsCandidate` permission class.

### Function
This endpoint allows candidates to apply for a job. Before creating a new application, the system checks if the candidate has already applied for the same job by querying the cache. If a cached result is found indicating the candidate has already applied, a response with the status "Already Applied" is returned. If no cached result is found, the system checks the database for any existing application. If the candidate has already applied, the result is cached, and the "Already Applied" response is returned. Otherwise, a new application is created, and the data is serialized and saved.

### Query
The query checks if the candidate has already applied to the job:
```sql
SELECT * FROM job_application WHERE candidate_id = {user_id} AND job_id = {job_id};
```

### Caching
The result of the application check is cached using the key `job_application_{user_id}_{job_id}`. If the candidate has already applied, the cache will store the response, and subsequent requests will return the cached result. If the candidate has not applied, a new job application is created, and the result is cached for future requests.

### Serialization
The data is serialized into JSON format using the `JobApplicationSerializer`. This serializer includes all relevant job application details, such as candidate and job information.

### Request Body
The request body must include the necessary details to create a job application. It typically includes information about the candidate and the job they are applying for.

```json
{
 "job": 3,
 "candidate": 2,
 "status": "applied",
 "cover_letter": "I am very excited to apply for the Software Engineer role. I believe my skills and experience align perfectly with the requirements for this position.",
 "resume": "path/to/resume.pdf",
 "expected_salary": 75000.00,
 "notice_period": "1 month"
}
```

### Response 200 (OK)
If the candidate has already applied for the job, a response with the following message is returned:
```json
{
     "status": "Already Applied"
}
```

### Response 201 (Created)
If the job application is successfully created, the response contains the serialized data of the new job application.
```json
{
     "id": 4,
     "application_date": "2024-11-16T16:44:48.978237Z",
     "status": "applied",
     "cover_letter": "I am very excited to apply for the Software Engineer role. I believe my skills and experience align perfectly with the requirements for this position.",
     "resume": "/documents/resumes/Profile_u2RvErU.pdf",
     "expected_salary": 75000.0,
     "notice_period": "1 month",
     "job": 3,
     "candidate": 2
}
```

### Response 400 (Bad Request)
If the request data is invalid or the job application fails validation, this response returns the serializer's validation errors.

### Response 404 (Not Found)
If the job ID does not exist in the database, this error will be returned with a message indicating that the job could not be found.

### Response 500 (Internal Server Error)
Catches unexpected errors and returns a generic error message.

## Update Application Status

### Endpoint
`PATCH {{base_url}}/application/status/application_id/`

### Permission
Only accessible by authenticated employers who created the job, as determined by the `IsEmployer` permission class.

### Function
Updates the status of a specific job application. This view ensures that only the employer who posted the job can update the application status. The status choices are limited to predefined options: "applied", "selected", "interviewed", "offered", and "rejected". Caching is used to optimize future requests for the same application status.

### Query
The query to update the application status in the database is:
```sql
UPDATE job_application 
SET status = {new_status} 
WHERE id = {application_id} 
AND job_id = {job_id};
```

The status field is updated based on the new value provided in the request. The allowed values for status are drawn from the `STATUS_CHOICES` field: 'applied', 'selected', 'interviewed', 'offered', and 'rejected'.

### Update Function
When the employer updates the status:
- The application is retrieved from the database using the `application_id`.
- The employer's identity is verified to ensure they created the job for which the application was submitted.
- The status of the job application is updated based on the provided status in the request data, and the change is saved to the database.

### Caching
The response data is cached with a cache key formatted as `job_application_status_{application_id}`. If the status is updated, the new status is saved and cached for future use. If a cached status exists, it is updated to reflect the latest change.

### Serialization
The status update process focuses only on the status field, so no full serialization of the job application is required. The status is validated against `STATUS_CHOICES`.

### Request Body
The request body should contain the status to be updated. The allowed values are:
- "applied"
- "selected"
- "interviewed"
- "offered"
- "rejected"

```json
{
     "status": "selected"
}
```

### Response 200 (OK)
Returns a success message indicating that the job application's status was successfully updated. The new status is also cached for future requests.
```json
{
     "message": "Job Application's Status is updated."
}
```

### Response 400 (Bad Request)
If the employer is not authorized to update the job application status or if the status provided is invalid (not one of the `STATUS_CHOICES`), this response is returned with a message indicating that the update is not allowed.

### Response 404 (Not Found)
If no job application is found with the given `application_id`, this error is returned with an error message.

### Response 500 (Internal Server Error)
Catches unexpected errors and returns a generic error message.


# View a Job Application

## Endpoints
**GET** `{{base_url}}/application/status/application_id/`

### Permission
Only accessible by authenticated employers who created the job, as determined by the `IsEmployer` permission class.

### Function
Fetches all job applications for a specific job and provides the details of each job application, including job and candidate information. Caching is utilized to improve performance and reduce the database load for repeated requests.

### Query
The query to fetch the job applications from the database:
```sql
SELECT * FROM job_application WHERE job_id = {job_id};
```
The query retrieves all job applications for the specific job identified by `job_id`.

### Caching
The response data is cached with a cache key formatted as `job_applications_{job_id}`. If the job applications are already cached, the cached data is returned immediately to improve response time. If the job applications are not cached, they are fetched from the database, serialized, and then cached for future requests.

### Serialization
The job applications are serialized into JSON format using the `JobApplicationCandidateDetailsSerializer`. This includes job details, candidate information, and any other application-related data.

### Response 200 (OK)
Returns a list of job applications for the specified job. The data is either returned from the cache if it exists or fetched from the database and cached for future use.

# Apply A Subscription Plan

## Endpoints
**POST** `{{base_url}}/subscription/add/plan/`

### Permission
Accessible by authenticated users (the `CustomAuthentication` class is used for authentication).

### Function
Allows users to choose a subscription plan and save it in the database. The subscription details are validated and stored for the user.

### Validating Subscription
The method checks if the plan is provided and the `trial_start_date` is not set.

### Setting Trial Start Date
If the conditions are met, it calculates the `trial_start_date` by adding the plan's duration to the `start_date` field.

### Saving Data
After the necessary validation and modification, the method saves the subscription details to the database by calling `super().save()`.

### Query
The query to insert the chosen subscription plan into the database (assuming it's stored in a `UserSubscription` model):
```sql
INSERT INTO user_subscription (user_id, subscription_plan_id, start_date, end_date, status) 
VALUES ({user_id}, {subscription_plan_id}, {start_date}, {end_date}, {status});
```

### Serialization
The provided subscription data is serialized into the `UserSubscription` model using the `SubscriptionPlanSerializer`.

### Request Body
The request body should contain the subscription details to be saved, including the subscription plan ID, start date, end date, and any other necessary data.
```json
{
     "user": 1837,
     "plan": 8
}
```

### Response 201 (Created)

# What is a Cron Job?

A cron job is a time-based job scheduler in Unix-like operating systems, which I use to run tasks automatically at specified intervals or times.

## How Does It Work in Django?
I use `django-cron`, a third-party package, to integrate cron jobs into my Django project. I define the logic for the job in a class that inherits from `CronJobBase`, and I specify a schedule (like every 10 minutes). The `do()` method contains the code I want to run when the cron job executes.

### Example Breakdown
In the cron job example, it runs every 10 minutes (`Schedule(run_every_mins=10)`). It checks all active subscriptions (`UserSubscription.objects.filter(is_active=True)`).

- If the trial date has passed and auto_renew is enabled:
  - I update the `start_date` and `trial_start_date`.
- If auto_renew is disabled:
  - I mark the subscription as expired (`has_expired = True`) and inactive (`is_active = False`).

### Key Benefits
- I can automate recurring tasks.
- It saves me time and resources by handling background processes for me.
- I can customize the intervals (e.g., minutes, hours, days) to fit my needs.
